# learn-selenium
Just the things I googled here and there while learning selenium ðŸ˜„

<h1> K K Let's get started </h1>
Actually, the thing I'm trying to do here is selenium-webdriver using rspec. Since, there were limited documentations/articles it was kinda hustle bustle. I'm gonna list my findings. Feel free to check it out if you find it helpful.  
 
In coming days, I'll also upload codes from my learning phase. Trust me its gonna be so much noober code keek. 

Okies. Here are the links that I found interesting.
